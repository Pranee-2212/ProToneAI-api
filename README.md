# ToneMentor

## Project Overview

**ProTone** is an AI-powered API designed to help users, especially non-native English speakers, communicate more professionally in corporate environments. The system analyzes the tone of a given message, compares it to a professional standard, and determines if rewriting is necessary. If so, it can rephrase the message in a more professional tone.

**NOTE**: I am learning pleanty of things through this project and its is a really good experience and feel free to ignore some rookie mistakes 😅😅, i still learnig and stuck on some issues and feel free the edit the code i am open to suggestions on this project 

## Phase 1: Tone Detection API

### Features

- **REST API with Flask:**  
  Provides endpoints for basic server health checks and tone prediction.

- **Tone Classification:**  
  Accepts a message via a POST request and returns a tone classification result using a machine learning model.

- **Modular Design:**  
  Code is organized for easy extension and future improvements.

### How It Works

1. **Send a POST request** to `/predict` with a JSON body containing a `text` field.
2. **The API analyzes** the tone of the message and returns the classification result in JSON format.

#### Example Request

```json
POST /predict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Could you please send me the report by tomorrow?"
}
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "tone": "polite",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

## Phase 2: Professional Rewriting (Work in Progress)

- **Automated Rewriting:**  
  The next phase will enable the API to automatically rewrite messages that are not professional, enhancing clarity, tone, and formality and 
  sent along with the response .

- **User Feedback Loop:**  
  Users will be able to review and accept or reject suggested rewrites.
